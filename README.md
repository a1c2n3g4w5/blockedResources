blockedResources
================

In China, the notorious platform of censorship, namely GFW, blocked all Google sites. As a consequence, now many js lib such as webfont.js and jQuery are not available.

I happened to recommend a front-end template called <a href="http://loneceo.com/landing-dream-free-cssxhtml-responsive-template/">Landing Dream</a>, which has very nice styles but requires webfont.js and jQuery from Google CDN, so I have to modify its home page and place some blocked resources here.

I'll keep copying blocked js resources to this repository. 

<b>GFW is evil. Damn it.</b>
